# CS 61B: Data Structures, Spring 2018

I’ve done almost all of them, except <font color=blue>project 2</font>, <font color=red>hw 5-7</font>, for they don’t seem that important to me. 

Due to my limited spare time, I didn’t complete those <font color=gold>gold points</font>.

Still, hope you could get some help from me, and of course, it’s my honor. 🧑‍💻

What a journey of learning! 💃
